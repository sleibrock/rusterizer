# Rusterizer - A Rusty Rasterizer

Rusterizer is a Rust-based graphics renderer aimed at being as fast as it can possibly be while being as low-dependency as possible.

## Objectives

* ~~Drawing pixels and lines~~
* ~~Drawing and filling rectangles and triangles~~
* Drawing and rendering circles
* ~~Color lerping and blending~~
* Proper float-based math library for small linear algebra
* Numerical approximations for slow-ish functions
